# Mockchain
This Repository will reflect all future work on the Mockchain.

Research has begun in the context of a Bachelorsthesis with the title 'Utilizing Dependency Relations in Arbitrary Blockchain Transactions for Recurring Block Minimization'. The thesis has since been completed.

Mockchain is not only a comfortable, minimalistic tool to evaluate a generic Blockchain application, it also features an experimental, though fully operational concept for block minimization after the fact. Certain applications can employ it and get better results compared to normal pruning.

Current development focuses on adding distribution and turning the Mockchain into a ...chain. The problem that this change will make the name 'Mockchain' misleading is known to the author.
