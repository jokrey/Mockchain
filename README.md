# Mockchain
This Repository will reflect all future work on the Mockchain.

Research has begun in the context of a Bachelorsthesis with the title 'Utilizing Dependency Relations in Arbitrary Blockchain Transactions for Recurring Block Minimization'. The thesis has since been completed.

Mockchain is not only a comfortable, minimalistic tool to evaluate generic Blockchain applications, it also features an experimental, though fully operational concept for block minimization after the fact. Certain applications can employ it and get better results compared to normal pruning.
This can be seen as a next step in blockchain technology, making it a prime candidate for a new programming model, which allows simplified development of fully distributed applications.

The Mockchain has since received network functionality(Link2Peer), turning it into a N(otM)ockchain. The author is aware that this change will make the name 'Mockchain' misleading.
